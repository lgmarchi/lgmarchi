# Hello, Guys! I'm Lucas Marchi :metal: 

üíª Rust Engineer on [Satellite.im](https://github.com/Satellite-im)

## üòÄ About me
Senior Software developer with over 5 years of experience, centering my expertise on Rust and also proficient in Dioxus (a React-based framework), Flutter, and Svelte. I began my journey by leading the development of a mobile application from the ground up, integrating Firebase for authentication and real-time data. This experience strengthened my foundation in cross-platform development, Agile methodologies, and team leadership.

In recent years, I have focused on the Rust ecosystem, mastering the language to build high-performance, multi-platform solutions‚Äîincluding desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux‚Äîwith a Warp backend. I have also broadened my skill set with Svelte and Capacitor, creating robust web and mobile applications that incorporate advanced video and low-latency communication features using PeerJS and Trystero.

I thrive in collaborative environments and maintain a results-oriented mindset, continually refining my skills to deliver impactful solutions that meet business needs and offer an exceptional user experience.

## :fire: Open-source Projects

### [Uplink Desktop](https://github.com/Satellite-im/Uplink)
Privacy First, Modular, P2P messaging client built atop Warp.

Uplink is written in pure Rust with a UI in Dioxus (which is also written in Rust). It was developed as a new foundation for implementing Warp features in a universal application.

The goal should be to build a hyper-customizable application that can run anywhere and support extensions.

### [Uplink Web]()
Privacy First, Modular, P2P messaging client built atop Warp.

Uplink is written in TS with Svelte. It is developed as a new foundation for implementing Warp features in a universal application.

The goal should be to build a hyper-customizable application that can run anywhere and support extensions.
