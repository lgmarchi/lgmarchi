## :fire: Open-source Projects

### [Uplink Desktop](https://github.com/Satellite-im/Uplink)
Privacy First, Modular, P2P messaging client built atop Warp.

Uplink is written in pure Rust with a UI in Dioxus (which is also written in Rust). It was developed as a new foundation for implementing Warp features in a universal application.

The goal should be to build a hyper-customizable application that can run anywhere and support extensions.
