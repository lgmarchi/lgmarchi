# Hello, Guys! I'm Lucas Marchi :metal: 

üíª Senior Rust Engineer and Senior Flutter Developer

## üòÄ About me
I'm a passionate software engineer with over 8 years of experience, and I've found my purpose in building high-performance, scalable applications. Specializing in Rust, I love working with libraries like Tokio, Actix Web, Axum, Rayon, Serde, and Sqlx to create reliable systems and optimize performance through advanced multithreading. I'm also well-versed in databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Firestore, always aiming to build solutions that are robust and built to last.

In the mobile space, I've launched my own apps and contributed to projects that have reached over 10 million users. Using Flutter, along with state managers like MobX, Bloc, and GetX, I focus on crafting smooth and intuitive user experiences.

Colleagues often describe me as a friendly and creative teammate, known for quick problem-solving and a strong commitment to clean, maintainable code. I'm constantly learning and evolving, always ready to take on the next big challenge.

## :fire: Open-source Projects

### [Uplink Desktop](https://github.com/Satellite-im/Uplink)
Privacy First, Modular, P2P messaging client built atop Warp.

Uplink is written in pure Rust with a UI in Dioxus (which is also written in Rust). It was developed as a new foundation for implementing Warp features in a universal application.

The goal should be to build a hyper-customizable application that can run anywhere and support extensions.
